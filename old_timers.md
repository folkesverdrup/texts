## Old Timers

*A short story from our weekly newsletter, 01. October, 2021.*

*By Folke Sverdrup* 





Its spring in Manhattan and two old friends are meeting in the park after a shared late lunch. The sun is just starting to peek over the skyscrapers of downtown and the pink, polluted clouds out by JFK way - central way across the highways where the cars drive out of Manhattan for the busy airport – and it’s still early. There’s new asphalt here, which was just laid on the streets outside Central Park by those strong, older working guys. Those last couple of days outside the park is the subject of conversation today, when our two friends meet for their biweekly coffee in the park. On cloudy days - or sunny days like today, on early afternoons like this, when it has just rained and the dew is so beautiful, they meet to talk.

Today the dew is infused with the smell of baked asphalt, fresh, like evil-overbaked bread. It’s raw and it smells of the liquid soles and bike tires of unfortunate commuters, whose new, cool trainers melt as the sole fuses with that fresh, brownie like substance we use for our cars to drive on. And the dew that morning is infused with this other, bad mist. This mist is to them more like something out of Dante, brimming and fuming, making an almost a hissing noise - it’s bubbling blackness and oozing puss and orange rays would gleam over this scene as the old friends were sitting down, discussing the smell of the asphalt and one friend telling the other - that he can't smell anything. 

And. – 

TOM

> Don't you remember? 
>
> What.

What, he says. This is the reply of our friend, whom we'll call Brady. 

...

BRADY 

> Whay? What.  

Our other friend forgets to reply. This is our blonde friend. He looks a distinguished old veteran, one that would look great in a uniform, even at old age. And he’s a handsomely dressed older gentlemen at that. We'll call him Tom. 

TOM

> It’s like something out Dante, Brady.

BRADY 

As though he was quoting someone, but he’s not- he says. 

> The city fills up with hissing and fuming bubbling blackness, and its oozing puss. Spirits in suits and women spirits traverse the streets along abandoned brownstones and those rusting cast iron fire escapes and industrial windows where leaves have breached through the rotting frames and bathe in the sunlight inside those large bastions of early 18th century industry. 

Brady adds this to the scenario he is painting for Tom - 

BRADY

> And one of the spirits in suits gets mowed down by a spirit ambulance, and his spirit guts fly over the windshield as his body breaks up into little, nasty pieces of ectoplasm and spirit-inners splash out over the streets and the spirit traffic under those early July morn’ rays. 

TOM

> 'As I was walking among the fires of hell, delighted with the enjoyments of Genius, which to Angels look like torment and insanity. 

BRADY

> Terrific stuff Tom, well done. 

TOM

> Thanks - It’s a beautiful picture. Like our old William Blake there, the first true contrarian wrote so lovingly of the Messiah.

 Tom gestures – 

> -Satan. 

Tom could quote William Blake very well, his father - a pastor and a formidable preacher of their old Russian congregation had made sure he was a well-read man. Tolstoy, Blake, Stendhal and that old Swedish theologian Emmanuel Swedenborg, and his three seminal texts which Tom knew almost by heart but not quite. *Divine Love, Heaven and Hell,* and last *Divine Providence.* He was quoting those almost forgotten words today, not Swedenborg *Heaven and Hell* - but his beloved Blake’s' *The Marriage of Heaven and Hell'*

TOM

> Rintrah roars & shakes his fires in the burden'd air; 
>
> Hungry clouds swag on the deep.



He adds, pointing at Brady – 



> Pretty good, no? 



BRADY



> You're a distinguished man Tom, everyone says so. And well read, good taste. 
>
> Blake, Stendhal.



Tom

> Not to forget Kierkegaard or Swedenborg. Father would be furious if we forget either of those two. 



BRADY



> Sure, sure. Kierkegaard is not easily forgotten either, when you’ve read him. Its Blake today though. 

TOM

> 'Tis, 'Tis. He chuckles.

TOM 

> He writes, Blake does – 



> That the original Archangel, or possessor of the command of the heavenly lost. 

He continues, adding - 

> Heavenly lost. Beautiful, uh? 
>
> \- Command of the heavenly lost, is call'd the Devil or Satan, and his children are call'd Sin & Death.



BRADY



> It’s just like today, with our fuming asphalts. 



Tom goes on, uninterrupted - 



> ...In the book of Job, Milton's Messiah is call'd Satan. 



BRADY



> By God. Is that so, Tom? 



TOM



> 'Tis, 'Tis. 



They share a laugh about that. And then they sit. Not playing chess or backgammon like other old men. No bright orange prayer beads or dominoes - they simply sit and watch. Two old friends who enjoy each other. 



Tom goes on, finally. He's talkative today.

> Look! 

He says.

He points out past the low hanging trees to the buildings rising up behind the steel railing and the bushes that separate them from the noisy traffic outside.

Rays gleam over the large reflective red and pink surfaces of that aluminum clad town, and everything is so bright the way only Manhattan can be bright on an early summer morn’ like today. In the morning, with all its light that bounces and refracts crazily all over downtown by the brass ox - and down 42nd and Broadway, which it shines across splendidly – it separates, and refracts and hits the two old men square in their eyes, and they squint and lower their brows

It shines across a busy taxi. Across bikers and hasty commuters. Some, who are packing together their umbrellas after the rain earlier that morning, a rain that lasted only a couple of minutes. The clouds passes again with those rays of sun streaking through. Others are fixing the gearboxes on their bikes and motorcycles, and others again - like an underpaid and over-educated foreign taxi driver who is there on his work visa – pulls down his windshields and the car fills up with the boozy-y smell of a taxis windshield washer fluid in and over the front windshields. Our taxi driver spits up some slime with his old smokers cough. A camel cigarette cough that he shared with all those boys from his old company who all smoked camel cigarettes in that dirty, sand-covered shit hole that was all covered and nasty with camel dung and feces. Where they had lived and fought and laughed together until they left, and never spoke again. They had smoked together he recalled now, and some of those boys whom fell on those awful hours he only faintly remembers now. That morning, when they took that terrible foreign stretch of land near some war-torn border far away. It was in that far-away place out by the gulf where it was warm and dangerous. Humid, before the humidity turned to sand as they made their way inland. The humidity turned to sand in their lungs and they blistered, then peeled and turned from pink to pinker, until red completely. 

He thought of his wife that morning, and how she would always yell at him, his name she'd yell at him- 

> Micha!

 His wife would yell at him when he came home late after drinking with his other foreign taxi driver friends- 

> Micha!

She'd yell at him - Micha, in that old Persian language - 

> Micha! 

Where are those fifteen dollars I gave you to go see about our washer?-

> Micha! Where is that money! 

She'd yell at him. 

Micha would mumble something, he was drunk that day and bummed and feeling sorry for himself for that he'd boozed away all those fifteen dollars after work with his  buddies which were meant for fixing their washer-machine which was tumbling and pissing off the neighbors and his wife.  

Then-- she'd would go on yelling at him and once in a blue moon they would have sex but that was many years ago. Now they slept in separate rooms ever since their last boy had left for school.

 Now, more often than not she'd yell at him - and most times he was deserving of the yelling since he'd boozed away their money for laundry or something or other, and other stupid things he was guilty of losing or spending or fucking up somehow. One time he had slept with a work friend of hers but in gods honest truth he hadn’t even put it in her. He’d had to many whiskeys and was limp as an old sailor down there, but he'd tried at that was what had mattered to Sasha. That was her name. Sasha. She had taken him back after four months of repenting his sins in a terrible little hostel where prostitutes and old sailors, drunks and lustful men made disgusting, ungodly noises in the night. After twenty odd years with Micha she'd become old and mean to him, but she took him back and he'd have her because she was familiar, and him the old lousy drunk to her too. They had each other in that foreign, tall city they’d come to many years ago now. Because she knew he was too much of a coward to fight back - Sasha, who wore a niqab even at home and who can remember how her husband had become a deovut,and silently angry man after his treatment by his countrymen after some twenty-five odd years before those two towers fell and americans turned their heads towards the muslim world once again to wage ungodly war on lesser nations and foreign peoples. Hed gotten angry and she'd gotten jumpy then, and always on edge. He couldnt see of course, that she'd had two abortions and was on prozac from under the table by her understanding female doctor - another over-worked, middle eastern woman who took pity upon the old beaten up wife, and given her pain killers that kept her from falling apart under the angry, overworked and underpaid and mistreated after the towers fell-type man who raises his hand to her on bad days where he shamefully drinks in the car, But after a bad fall he'd become (the) weak and beaten (one), and Sasha took the role of the mean man. Anyways, this taxiguy Micha pulls downs the screens and flips down the aviator shades attatched and held over his glassed type sunglasses and narrows his eyes in the morning sun. Its all steel and glass and glass down there. All of that big city. Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. . All the bridges and those currents, those large rivers that seperate that old indian land from which the settlers drove them out. First with guns and blankets with sick on them. Most of them died then, all the old injuns, which they called them, and worse - Then, the last warriors stood, the fresh young and sweaty men whom had fought til they also almost all died. Then the last of those men met with those superior(equipped!! Expand, were the white soldiers really superior? Think u can make this more interesting, native americans were hella warriors but couldn’t compete with gunpowder, think u could write someth really nice here) white soldiers and they offered them a sum. Something ridiculous like two cases of rum or something nasty like that. Like all our stories concerning those old natives Tom thought out loud speaking to Brady who was very used to Toms ruminations about the past and present of their island, of Manhattans story. The East India company, they called them. 

He stops telling his story, and listens to the water evaporating in those early morning rays. Dew over the fields, a hushing sound across the park, and that bloaty asphalt smell -as mothers and children who just got out of bed are storming across the pavement of the bike lanes, rushing to get to their nice private school, just across the park from where they live in their swanky old and renovated brownstones by the park. Every (day) these stressed parents and nervous kids would run, and when it was the fathers turn, the old friends could see, and this was without failure, consistently and always. Always late - always running, with little girl in hand - the father, rushing and panting(new word, panting is what a dog does to breathe) her little hand in his cuffed hand, and with her little school uniform. And her rushing to catch up to her daddy, who is in a black or blue suit depending on his temperament that morning Looking almost like that hack actor in the commercial, a slick old and older Dressman type lookingHollywood type. A guy who holds his grip hard on his little girls arm as he drinks his Nespresso. A triple cortado - hot with milk. Three esspresso shots and he yells at her over his vodka covered hoarse voice and three day beard with dark Olivers Peoples frames over his nose close to his probalby blood shot eyes from partying with lewd girls and the amphetamine sweats - furiosuly he yells at her,

> Comeeeeon Matilda, fucking hell - We'll be late again!

He rushes with her , her small hand and albow with dress arm stretched from his fuming grip.

TOM 

>  Not a very nice scene, ill say that. What a guy. 

BRADY

> No. Not a very nice scene. 

TOM 

> Not a very nice daddy. 

BRADY 

> No, not a very nice daddy. 

Brady nods sternly to Tom, looking up at him. 

> But at least he's taking her himself - and not the nanny. 

Tom and Brady laugh together about that, and keeps talking. .

BRADY

> Funny, no?...Anyways. 

Tom and Brady - these two guys, theyre old buddies from the 117th regiment. Sometimes Tom and Brady would sit in silence, and listen in their local bar. Perhaps one time, this guy, this angry old timer at the round table in the back, he'd start going. To most of them, im sure - it sounded like crazy old junky guy. But to those two army boys, theyd heard those noices before. from the mouths of those boys...He stops, and swallows.

He continiues

>  Those boys. Navy boys who went to those beaches down there in the pacific - in that old country. Korea, he says this sternly.

These guys didnt talk about that. None of those boys liked to speak about those days - instead they meet, and they drink. and sometimes they laugh. And once in a while, when a young marine, or a young soldier from the army comes in with his girl under his arm - all these guys. All these old timers, they light up, and drink together and they drunkenly recounts old times and tell stories of heroes and old friends and old sweethearts and broken hearts and dead young soldiers whose mothers missed them, and the young soldier was back for two weeks before going back out there to the jungle and the old men felt his heart and his fear and were silently glad they werent that young boy going back to fight a war on those new foreign beaches where young men are sent to die for peace, but all Tom and Brady has learnt since that was that going to war with someone was absurdity personified, and war was an ungly thing for men to do to eachother. 

The young guy and the girl in the floral dress drank and listened. And this girl- this beautiful girl - she would sit with these old timers, and she would listen to their stories. 

Tom says then,

> Man, its like something out of a painting, ill tell you that.

And Brady replies 

> Im sure. It sounds like it. Beautiful. 

Tom again.

> She was beautiful, man. Thats...thats what she was. 

They sit in silence for a while, before Tom starts a new conversation, less serious this time, a conversation more akin to the ones theyd accustomed themselves to over the last boring and uneventful years of their lives where its all about those grandkids and those expensive private school their stressed kids would talk about with them on the phone about. 

Tom starts  

> I went to see this Scorsese movie the other day.
>

BRADY

> Oh yeah, he states . midly tickled by Toms coming anecdote -
>

TOM 

> Yeah.
>

BRADY

> And? We're waiting in silent speculation here Tom, what was the movie called? 
>

TOM

> It wa called Silence, I believe. He then adds, right back at him 'Brady'. coldy, then giggling. Then finally, giving up, Brady giggling too. This girl behind me she wouldnt stop giggling and glancing at her phone you know, during the movie. You know, bright screen in a dark theater.
>

BRADY

> Oh yeah? what happened with the giggling girl man.
>

TOM

> Here's the thing - Her boyfriend was sitting beside her, and he kept telling her to shut up, or like - 
>

BRADY

> Yeah? 
>

TOM

*Shut up bitch, I can't hear a fucking thing* 

Tom mimicks the guy, angry and with raised shoulders - 

Tom goes on,

> Things of that nature, his raised eyebrows under heavy hands as he looks up at guy from under his raised shoulders. So.
>

BRADY

> So.
>

Tom stretches. He breathes out, and then he continiues - 

>  So he finally got up, you know - and he grabbed her phone, threw it into the moviechair. It bounces of the seat..
>

 Tom raises his eyebrows. Then  

> BOOM! 



Tom slaps his hand on the pillow, like this - 

> *SLAP* 

BRADY

> Yeah?
>

TOM 

> Yeah - he threw the phone, so - then he grabs the girl, fucking chokes her - and let me tell you dude, she's not giggling anymore.
>

Brady gulps, now completely transfixed after the SLAP and the BOOM! adds to Tom story - 

> \- No?
>

TOM 

> No man Ill tell you. He's like this big, mean looking fuck. Prison tattoos. Old gang-banger - large type asshole, probably rapes. Probably wouldve been a good lietenaunt or legionnaire or something like that, in that roman empire. Man, those guys practiced war like it was fucking sport, all tactital and shit. They'd fuck everyone up. 
>

BRADY

> Yeah, so? Why are you talking about roman legionnaires all a sudden? 
>

TOM

> Cus this guy, Im telling you. - This guy couldve been one of those roman legionnaires.
>

BRADY

> Sure, alright. 
>

TOM

>  This guy.
>

He pauses telling the story of the guy.

He continiues after a large gulp of his black coffee with a little something something hush hush in it. 

> Mmm 

he wipes his mouth. 



>  Ill tell you, the way she went down with that hit he delivered there, man oh man. Oh boy. I'll never forget. Never. Man -she, she...

Tom is into it, now reliving it, his eyes distant as if looking back to remember. He is running out of breath and he runs his hand and his seating brow he wipes with his handkerchief fetched from under the table by the pond where they sit in the park during spring if its cloudy or sunny all while trying to catch his old breath. If its sunny, they sit with black sunglasses over a chess table there in the heart of central park, both of them living nearby in old brownstones - old money types, - Tom and Brady, From those old Brooklyn and Queens families. Proud Jewish Polacs, Russians and bygod, even some Irish No Englishmen, no siree - that would be going to far - Some of those old families held long grudges. Some never left Manhattan since they came over with the first settlers there

TOM 

> And yeah, so shes she's fucking screaming - crying her little heart out when he punshes her right in the kidneys. 
>

BRADY

> Shit. Jesus Christ. 
>

TOM

> Yeah you bet dude, this guy was pissed. 
>

BRADY

> Thats what he was. Fucking christ almighty this guy sounds like a real jerk this guy. Jesus.
>

TOM

> Yeah man you bet - and she, you know, she fucking croaks- limbs rushing in, holding her kidneys - she can't breathe. She's not fealing great.
>

BRADY

> No, can't imagine so, no - jesus. 
>

TOM

> You can say that again...
>

BRADY

> ...So
>

TOM

> So what.
>

BRADY

> So...You know.

 Brady pauses, taking in all that fucked up scuff Tom just laid on him there just then. Tom continiues with his story.

> He realises he punched his girl in front of all these people, you know, pretty hard you know, raised brows again. And Im sure he's not so keen on facing more years for publicly layng it down to his girl there, in a theatre non the less.
>

BRADY

> Yeah. 
>

Tom yeahs' affirmately, and continiues -

>  \- So he's not feeling great, you know - He's about ready to leave I recon. 
>

he bites his fingernails and mutters from the corner of his mouth and with those bushy raised brows he continiues - 

> ..So!
>

he goes on. 

> So - he takes the girl. 

He raises his hand, showing her. 

*Bitch*

 Bitch, he calls her. Tom flips his hand up, gesturing--hee flexes his fingers backwards slowly, then out again fast as he brings it down and slaps the pillow. 

> PANG!
>

He brings his hand accross his face - under his voice as he pulls her out of the dark theatre - everyone  there whispering 

> jesus, omg! Is she alright?

And under hushed voices 

*Did you see what happened? I think he hit her. Did you see what happened?* 

BRADY

> Then what, what happens.
>

TOM

> What do you mean what happens, nothing fucking happens, like always- everyone forgets and goes on and the guy and the girl is probably out there still and hes probably still punching her in the fucking kidneys and nose and god knows where probably raping her by the looks of him. 
>

BRADY 

> Jesus fucking christ, Tom - what the fuck. 
>

He continiues, now completely realising what he just heard. 

>  what kind of a scuffed fucking story is that - christ man I just came to speak and relax with you and you lay that shit on me jesus, fuck man. Heavy. 
>

TOM 

> Heavy man, yeah - you can say that again. 
>

BRADY

> So. 

he continiues. 

> Anyways, how was the movie? 

TOM 

> Oh I don't know.
>

He thinks about it, then says.

> It was fine, I suppose. Kind of went over my head If I was to tells gods honest truth, hehe. 
>

TOM

> Hehe. Yeah.
>

BRADY

> Joker was supposed to be god though. 
>

TOM 

> I heard that too. 
>

BRADY

> It received standing ovation by some in Cannes and Toronto. But snubbed at the Oscars. Some true blooded Americans weren't so happy about that Bong Joon fella. Korean, Tom Brady adds.
>

TOM

> Oh yeah? How about that. 
>

BRADY

> Yeah he apparently walked away with ALL the prices this time. 
>

TOM

> With Parasite, that's right.
>

BRADY

> Mm, yeah.
>

TOM

> Did you see it? 
>

BRADY

> I didn't no. 
>

TOM

> I probably won't to tell Gods honest truth - Won't watch no damn gook director.  
>

BRADY

> Jesus, cool it with the anti-gook sentiments there Tom. They're people just like me and you, you know. 
>

TOM

> And the Zionists and the pakis, gooks, honkeys, towelheads wetbacks and the rednecks all share a big meal in the end.
>



Tom and Brady laugh, as Brady hushes Toms brashness in a pretend shame, in all honesty he almost explodes with laughter. 



###### The End.
