We'd woken up early after a short sleep. We recounted some things said the day before whilst drinking that'd we'd promised eachother we'd remember becuase it was simply to funny to just have dissapear as content from the world. 

Folke

> Did you ever do amphetamine for four days - not sleeping, and then try fucking? 

Noah

> You'll fuck like a fish.

Folke

> Like a strung out junkie fish, that's right. Feels divine though--Like a woozy high. 

Noah

> Wha, wha...

Pretending his fucking on four days of no sleep.

Noah

> What are you doing woman, where are you putting my dick, by god..that feel's good.

> Hgggnhmm, gaaaa-aaaah. 

and,

> FUUUCK LADY! That's it, yeah-yeah-yeah

Noah acts out the sleep deprivided fucking while I drink and spit my coffee out, laughing. 

Chris Isaac sings through the great speakers--

> *strange what desire* 
>
> *will make foolish people do* 
>
> *now I'll never dream that I'd love somebody like you*
>
> *And I never dreamed that I'd knew somebody like you.* 

A pious and god-fearing man meets his maker. 

Our friend, Noah--as he'd put it in ''quotation'' if he was asked at his friends funeral, would say of his friends passing when asked--

> did you know him well?

Noah--

> I knew him well, A man of immaculate taste. He would say, behind closed doors--that things we're much better in the 17th century. When women knew their place, funny stuff like that. He'd always joke.

...

Folke

> Well, wether he's dead or no--thats pretty misogenic, Noah.

Noah

> What do you mean, mysogenic? 

Folke 

> Like Sterling from Mad Men, Noah. Now this guy, Sterling - from Sterling and Cooper--he's the boss' son from the advertisement firm, Sterling and Cooper. He's an entitled, but charismatic and actually quite talented accounts man. He say's in respond to Donald Draper's question. 

Don asks,

> What do woman want? 

Sterling

> Who cares?



Sterling drinks fast his scotch as he replies.

Don chuckles and thinks, and on the train he writes:

*'Any reason to get closer.'* 

Next day, Don presents the slogan to the trans-atlantic nylon company. 

They give them the contract. They run Sal's commercial's to great succsess for that company in their next fiscal quarter. They would see an increase in revenue of 35% in their inner city departement stores. 

They went on to keep the contract running for eight more fruitful years. It is safe to say that the art departments large staff was largely economically viable, due to this income stream. Nineteen not obviously useful employees had their wages covered by that account alone. Seven of them paid of their morges entirely. 

Don thinks, and mutters under his breath...

> who cares?

He laughs at this. 

Ken Cosgrove covered the account for the trans-atlantic nylon company. He covered the meetings and hotel rooms for those businessmen from the midwest who sold corn syrup, who owned casinoes and airports and dealt in plastics and fabrics and we're very rich indeed.

He kept them company, and took them to exotic dancers--sometimes he'd bring escorts for smutty broadway shows, say that the escorts we're his cousins from out of town who needed to meet some rich men who'd show them a good time- The Midwestern businessmen were mor ethan happy to oblige Ken's cousins. Once he even brought a black escort and a oriental escort to the octaron for a bare-fisted boxing fight which ended spectacularly. 

Ken Cosgrove was a well liked man. and if anyone would forget his name, he's say charmingly.

> I'm Ken. Ken Cosgrove. Accounts. Here's my card. 

Noah

> Jees, I can't believe you remember all that stuff.

Folke

> It's good entertainment, Noah, Mad Men--quality content.
