Chapter I

An insidious rumor - The General and the spear - Traversing the Sund - Swedish border - Following the tracks

In a beautiful Baroque hall, five officers of the Danish army are sitting around, shooting die, drinking and having a grand old laugh. The scene is tenderly lit by tall candles mounted on grand, and elaborately profiled candle-holders, with mounds of molten wax at their feet. Early dawn light is peaking out behind the heavy curtains. A battery of kegs take up a corner of the room. Helmets and scabbards crowd the table, warmly reflecting the candle light.
A bout of laughter is settling down between them, as a knock on the door catches their attention. The men hurl insults at the door, but after a while, they let a blue-clad courier enter the hall. The courier is clutching a note with both hands, visibly nervous to deliver the message. It's addressed to the renowned Valdemar Rammer, who insists on having the message read out in front of his men. As the courier shares what amounts to a probable, but insidious rumor, Valdemar's face darkens. His betrothed has allegedly left town with another man. Another soldier. A Swede. He promptly reaches for his helm and sword, and rushes out the room, shouldering the courier on his way out. His footsteps resound in the stone stairwell. Thorvald approaches the ornate balcony doors. He braces himself - one hand clasping his coat tight, as the doors respond to him, slamming open. Wind and snow whirl into the room, blowing out the candles. The men gather their coats and join Thorvald on the balcony. The courier cries out to the huddling figures of wool and fur for an answer. One man turns his head over his shoulder. He scuffs. The kid idles. What will he tell the general? His eyes dart around the room, seeing none of the gilded furniture, none of the grand oil paintings, none of the marble tiled flooring. He stops himself, blinking twice, pirouettes, and rushes out the hall. The men snicker on the balcony. A grand slam across the courtyard beckons Valdemar's exit from the castle. His figure marches across the snow-covered grounds, his great coat sweeping a broad path behind him. The gates slam again. The courier runs to catch up, yelling at Valdemar, his voice muffled by thick snow. As they reach the moat, the courier grabs on to Valdemar. Valdemar stopsâ€”as does his coat. He turns, grabbing the boy by the shoulder. This lifts the boy, and he is flung head first into the embankment. He rolls into the moat, tangled in his coat. Valdemar marches.

(IN BETWEEN THE ACTION, WE TAKE A BREATH. COPENHAGEN IS SILENCED BY THE SNOW. IT IS WALLED - IT IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR REALITY, BUT ALSO SO FAMILIAR. THE PURPOSE HERE, WITH THIS SHOT, IS TO CREATE THE ATMOSPHERE, AND TO SCALE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE INSIDIOUS RUMOR - NOTHING ELSE SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING IN THE CITY. ONLY ONE THING IS OF IMPORTANCE, AND THE STREETS ARE SILENT (EVERYONE RECOGNISES THIS, EVERYONE HAS FELT THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY ONE'S IN THE CITY. 

(notes for this scene, what happened before? Valdemar is now geared up for Sweden and confronting the adulterer. All dull logistical questions are answered in the backpack, bitch (lore-boys suck your own tits - we don't give a shit about fucking five houses Martells suck a dick)).

- Valdemar arrives at the first gate. It's very snowy and very early morning. The first gate is colossal.
- Valdemar maybe talks to the guards? He has an important errand. They know who he is? They know about the rumor?
- As Valdemar exits the gate, he runs into the General
- The general hands the spear to V
- V exchanges his spear for the generals
- They exchange cool, knowing glances - very honourable!!! Very. cool. Men of action - dreamers stay home.
- Valdemar leaves the general
- Wide angle shot - Valdemar moves to second gate - space between the gates is **VERY COOL**. Filled with stairs and military imagery.
- Second gate! Drawbridge is shut - General motions for it to open - drawbridge opens
- Valdemar steps out of second gate - he is now on the sund. Alone. Very small. Big landscape. Bom.

(WE NEED SOME TIME TO PASS BETWEEN THE SCENES BECAUSE WHEN WE DO THE SUND SCENE, VALDEMAR HAS BEEN WALKING FOR A LOOOOONG TIME. HE'S ABOUT TO REACH THE WIRES, WHICH IS WHERE SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN!!! BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST HAVE HIM WALKING - THAT IS FUCKING BORING. CAN WE DO THIS IN A WAY THAT BREAKS UP THE MONOTONY WITHOUT BEING VERY FUCKING TROPE-ISH? THAT WOULD BE NICE. FOLKE WANTS JUST A SCENE OF SOME HOBOS - NOONES IS PAYING ATTENTION TO ANYONE, BUT THE HOBOS ARE HUDDLED OVER AROUND AN OIL CAN AND THEY'RE LIKE NEXT TO A CONTAINER THAT'S BEEN RANSACKED. BIG DRAMATIC BONFIRE SHADOWS ON THE PILLARS!!! SMALL FIGURE - BIG SHADOW. BOOM.).

SUND SCENE (very hypnotic, conveys a loooooong time)

- These notes are very image-brained, McCarthy-pilled, big fucking frames.
- The city is behind Valdemar.
- The sund is very big and very cold.
- He gets to Pebberholm. It's a scavenger hold-out. They have been there for a long time. There's a long trail of broken ice leading off into the ocean.
- Valdemar doesn't care about these bitches, although the imagery is VERY sweet and exposition (lore cunts suck these sweet droplets)
- As he comes past Pebberholm, the bridge rises from the island. The bridge is colossal and also VERY long.
- The sun is present in the landscape. Big shadows from the pillars. A winter fox or another mammal has a beautiful shadow. 
- The sun also penetrates the clouds. Birds taking flight looks sick. Spooked.
- There are hobos around the broken wiring of the bridge. They're doing some hobo scavenger npc idle bullshit. Who cares- not here for the hobos.
- As he gets close to Sweden, there's a period of something that's very just hypnotic almost before the scene changes.
