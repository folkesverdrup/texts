Satam and Notteneb, 

Square // Erauqs

taglines ''its not rac-y, its jeff koons-y´´

´´the title may not be serious, but the content is.¨

¨Tinted with content. Its fucking color thing, man. But darker, it blinds and shit. But we shine a ight on that CONTENT, THATT CONTINT''.

Songs for THTDs

To the chords of Auld Land Syne

Well meet beneath God's golden bridge - we'll kiss and hug again.

So fare thee well, my Josephine 

And take with you my ring 

I'll leave you now, for golden shores.

And old forgotten lands. 

Those old forgotten words were said,

From old forgotten texts

Poetry from years now passed

Oh Josephine, my dear.
