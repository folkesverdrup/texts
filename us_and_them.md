Them

> Fret naught, for you float atop your sleeping heart...

They say:

> ...Hey, look at us for a sec - 

US

> Yeah?

Them

> Do not drop that.

And

> Look at me, look at me, look at me--Hey, look at me!

They add 

> You do not drop that computer into the ocean. 

US

> Ya yaya-ya-ya-ya-ya, relax. 

They drone on, 

> Your precious files will dissapear along with the computer, if you sit with it like that. You'll lose all your precious articles...

 We're tipping the computer on our lap over the lip of the floating container in the old drydock where the boat houses lie nested up close with buyo-s splashing the water and the wind constantly agitating the leaves so that they'll stand nervous in lieu of that force of nature that holds regi over that place we're at. Copenhagen, Refshalvøen. we lie and dangle our legs over the end of the container ship, through the net, holding the computer.we're tipping the computer over the lip of the house boat taunting and visibly annoying our friend.

US

> NOMA just received their third Michelin star, finaly. 

Adding, 

> That place is nice, man - and it's right over there between us and Christiania. 

They, still eeying the dangling computer.

>  ...his computer'll float down in the water soon if you're not careful - Won't you promise to be careful?

We agree, reluctantly - pulling the computer of our lap and away from the edge,  over the bed we placed outside for us to sleep on. We like to sleep outside while it's still do-able, Fall has come to Copenhagen and we're looking dapper in our fall time clothes. Ready to pick mushrooms and to wear frocks. We sing to them,

> Di-di-di

They put ups to bed. They're tired of our antics. 

They say,

> It's not my fucking computer, it's your problem - it's his computer. 

They're fixing the place for us to sleep. They close and reopen the door, bringing us a glass of water. 

They go on,

> Drink this. Then we'll bring you another one. 

More, helpingly - 

> And before you sleep, can I get you anything? Don't you need to take a piss, brush? 

Us

> We need a shit pretty bad actually.

They

> Go, go do a shit - And then we'll see you in the morning. We've work to do. I've other work too but I'll set you up so you can program on your stuff. 

We sing, 

*I wanna be a millionaire, so fucking bad, Buy all of the things I never had.*

They

> Sleep now. we'll wake when we wake. around noon. Noon-is. 11300 - 1200. 

Us, childish-like

> Instant coffee and bread with butter. will you make this for us - please, we want it.

Them

> You'll make it yourself, you know the kitchen.

Us

> And Lady Godiva's Operation by The Velvet Underground on the small wireless speaker. 

We continiue, now about the food again.

> Some scrambled eggs for the bread, and sødmælk for the coffee - We'll be all squared off then. Then we'll do the prints for Fabresius and keep writing our epic novel on the last days of the Holy Roman Empire...

We tell them, 

> Through the eyes of two theatre actors - Satam and Nottenneb, and their boss--Tekra. The money lender and fence for the bourgeiouse and the non-trosthworthy masons that we're currently camped outside Rome, in the mountain region of Lazine, by the mountain range called Sabine where the river of Aniene is rushed through the brass piping of Villa D'ertre and all through those pipes and wonders of mechanical ingenuity, the most amazing spring waters flow over old, mossy statues of Zeus and Kreta and Posseidon--Posseidon, who resides over the waters of the park and whom is most prominent in his place where he is flanked by two grande stairs of marble with beautiful railings-- he stands, as he thriumps spectacularly over the other Gods, with his his Trident, his beard and - his muscles.

We, looking at them--saying,

> We told you all this already, no?

They nod. 

We continiue,

> A construction site lays on the north-west frontier of the Holy Roman empire, where Hadrion's wall marked the territory between the feuding natives, and those natives who tried to unite and fight back against the Roman stationaries who were holding them under soft siege. It marked eighty miles across unruly northern Britain from Wallsend to the river Tyne in the east to Bowness-on-Solway in the west. It was the most spectacular of the roman empire's foreign frontiers, and many men's bodies and bones lay buried there for future visitors to think of and dismiss as 'a bunch of shit that already happened'. 

We add,

> That's what history is man, just a bunch of stuff that already happened. When you think about it. 

They

> Well, I don't know about all that. But I'm not really in the mood if I'm going to be honest--to get into a whole thing. I'm going to bed now.

Us, humming - elated that they laid down so willingly tonight. 

Di-di-di

We sing,

> This love has taken its toll on me
> She said goodbye too many times before
> And her heart is breakin' in front of me
> And I have no choice, 'cause I won't say goodbye anymore
>
> Whoa
> Whoa
> Whoa...

We continiue, talking passionately,

> Now outside Rome, Hadrion had another project going, a passion project of his...Which would go on to become the Mekka, or a Jerusalem - for authors, poets and other creatives alike. The Swiss-french architect Charles-Édouard Jeanneret cited it as a most important visit in his developing as a young modernist thinker; artists like David Rauschenberg and  Cy Twombley apparantly came back several times together, probably to fuck in the ruins of the old bath houses. Hot stuff. 

We say

> What drew these great thinkers and sexual deviants to these ruins you might ask, and not others? 

They respond--after some thinking.

> Well maybe it was for or the decadents and the gluttonous penchants of aestheticians and those gentiles, but still--the bounty of riches  the church in those years flaunted was unmatched, and of the empire under the rule of their emperor, Hadrion - who built all that brilliant stuff. The church recided in Rome and Venice, where they built the greatest churches, draped in statues, with clocktowers and wicked gargoyles. Hadrion's Villa might be great, but it aint nothing like that.

They think for a moment, then say

>  Maybe it was to walk amongst those long ago parties.Try to envision the splendors, and...

Us

> Yeah?

They

> You know what, let's talk about something else. 

Us, chanting 

> WHATS ON YOUR MIND!
>
> WHATS ON YOUR MIND!
>
>  WHATS ON YOUR MIND!

and,

> SPEAK ON IT BROTHER,
>
> SPEAK!
>
> SPEAK!

Them

> I saw the new Nolan film recently, Tenet.

They add, 

> It was all a little over my head, to be honest. Bloated. Hollow.

We

> No, we didn't much care for it either. 

They say, finally - 

> God, I never went to bed huh. 

We say,

> No, no you didn't.
