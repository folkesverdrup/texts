In a world fundamentally preoccupied with respect and honor, a Copenhagen military officer named [VALDEMAR] Rammer is going about his peace-time duties. They mostly consist of socializing - that means drinking - in tenderly lit Baroque [HALLS]. When a rumor reaches Valdemar of an alleged affair between his wife Krysilda and an officer from the Swedish High Command, Valdemar [ACTS OUT] dramatically, and eventually rushes off to find the adulterer and redeem his name. As he leaves [COPENHAGEN] through the [CITY WALL], he is confronted by his superior [OFFICER] and his guard. Wordlessly, and with severe military pomp, Valdemar is handed a ceremonial [SPEAR] by the [OFFICER]. They exchange knowing nods, after which Valdemar begins to traverse the iced-over [SUND]. The journey on foot is long and ardous, the wind blowing fiercely. He travels along and underneath the old [BRIDGE], sticking closely to the massive concrete [PILLARS] penetrating the ice. Valdemars [GREAT COAT] sweeps the ground behind him as he walks, so he leaves a cleared path in his wake. The [SPEAR] is mounted on his back, like a banner. The [SHADOWS] from the [PILLARS] are long, as they slowly [SWEEP] across the ice. Golden [RAYS] penetrate the heavy clouds. [VALDEMAR] reclines upon his [GREAT COAT] on an embankment of snow, and gulps down his [RATIONS].



VOICEOVER:

In a beautiful Baroque hall, five officers of the Danish army are sitting around, drinking and having a grand old laugh. The scene is tenderly lit by tall candles mounted on grand, and elaborately profiled candle-holders, with mounds of molten wax at their feet. A digital screen is mounted at the far end of the room, showing a continuous reel of what appears to be news. No one is paying attention to it. Early dawn light is peaking out behind the heavy curtains. A battery of kegs, probably empty, takes up a corner of the room. Helmets and scabbards crowd the table, warmly reflecting the candle light. The men are in loose uniform [point of discussion?].  A bout of laughter is settling down between them, as one of them, Thorvald, starts telling another joke: [THE JOKE]:

​	"Let's see if I can remember this one... It's really good. Mikkelsen told it to me. So the Danish king, the Norwegian king and the Swedish king are meeting up to discuss the reestablishment of the Kalmar Union. The Danish king first puts forward his demands. He wants the Norwegian and the Swedes to swear eternal fielty to the Danish Crown. The Norwegian wants simply to be left alone, unbothered by the squabbles of the other countries. The Swede is fumbling with a piece of paper, as the Dane and the Norwegian go over the terms of the agreement. As the other parts are nearing a conclusion, the Swede starts to feel the heat and finally raises his voice. [In mocking swedish accent]: (something stupid, get on with it)... PUNCHLINE!

The men scuff.

​	"Why do you keep telling jokes? You're bad at telling jokes. It's so much funnier when you just speak your flat Juttish brain out loud. Like earlier when the wenches were here, and you said if you had a million Marks you would get every hooker in the capital for one night and fuck them all at the same time. [trying to hold back laughter] Mads, how many hookers do you think that is?"

​	"In the capital or for a million mars?"

​	"Whichever, I think both are a bit out of reach..."

Mads lulls it over for a little bit, then says:

​	"For a million you could probably get 500 or 600... maybe 700 if you sweettalk the ruffian. I don't know there's that many in the capital..."

​	"I don't know our joker here would have the stamina for more than two"

Thorvald looks dumbfounded. He doesn't seem to know if he should take offense. He replies:

​	"Yeah, well, maybe not 700, but I'd give at least two of those girls my best go at it" 

A knock on the door interrupts their snickering.

​	"Fuck off"

​	"Office is closed"

​	"No entry! Military secr-... busi-... NO ENTRY!"

A yell comes from the other side of the door

​	"Urgent message for Valdemar. It's a matter of honor."

Valdemar slowly turns his head and fixes his stare on the man across from him. The men turn silent. He yells:

​	"Come in, then".

A courier, slight of stature, clad in blue, enters and closes the door behind him. He's clutching a letter with both hands.

​	"A letter for Valdemar"

​	"Oh, come on, you know what it says. Out with it"

​	"The matter at hand, uhm... Is it possible we could.. under four eyes?"

​	"Anything you can say to me, you can say to men"

​	"I really think, sir, if you would.."

​	"SPEAK!"

​	"Well, sir, it's just a rumor, sir, but... We have witnesses alleging that Mrs. Rammer has left Copenhagen, sir."

​	"What? Where to?"

​	"To uhm.. To Sweden, sir. She was seen with a Swedish man of the sword"

​	"Who?"

​	"An officer, sir, an officer of the High Command, navy apparently, he's-"

​	"His name. Give me his name."

The courier hesitates. All the men are staring fixedly at him. He starts and stops a few times, before uttering:

​	"Gustav Gödelov"

The men move their stares to Valdemar. There's a period of silence. Valdemar stares at the table for two seconds, then says:

​	"Well."

He collects his scabbard and his helmet, and leaves without saying another word, brushing past the courier. We hear his loud footsteps as he rapidly descends the stone stairs. The men get up from around the table and exchange glances. One man looks at the courier, who promptly leaves the room, then moves towards the balcony, where he draws the curtains. Dawn light floods the hall, as the men gather on the balcony, watching Valdemar storming out the house gates and further on across the courtyard and the drawbridge that spans the moat.

VOICEOVER [DOGMATICALLY WITHOUT DIALOGUE]

In a beautiful Baroque hall, five officers of the Danish army are sitting around, shooting die, drinking and having a grand old laugh. The scene is tenderly lit by tall candles mounted on grand, and elaborately profiled candle-holders, with mounds of molten wax at their feet. Early dawn light is peaking out behind the heavy curtains. A battery of kegs take up a corner of the room. Helmets and scabbards crowd the table, warmly reflecting the candle light. | A bout of laughter is settling down between them, as a knock on the door catches their attention. The men hurl insults at the door, but after a while, they let a blue-clad courier enter the hall. The courier is clutching a note with both hands, visibly nervous to deliver the message. It's addressed to the renowned Valdemar Rammer, who insists on having the message read out in front of his men. As the courier shares what amounts to a probable, but insidious rumor, Valdemar's face darkens. His betrothed has allegedly left town with another man. Another soldier. A Swede. He promptly reaches for his helm and sword, and rushes out the room, shouldering the courier on his way out. His footsteps resound in the stone stairwell. | The men gather at the balcony, watching as Valdemar traverses the castle courtyard. The courier follows close 



The men, still left in the hall, exchange glances - this act of blatant disregard will be swiftly dealt with. One of them runs towards the balcony doors, and flings them open. Icy winds permeate the halls. The men reach for the great woolen coats, dress up, and huddle on the rounded balcony, watching for Valdemar. 

- The men acknowledge the severity (it's grim) 
- Thorvald [Valdemar's man (hes the doctor from the duellists, basically)) stands, kicking the chair back - in a swift motion, the jacket on the backrest is now over his shoulders (like Napoleon). He walks calmly to the , and opens the balcony doors. The rest of the men join him on the the balcony. 
- [The situation sobers the men immediately - their drunken banter turns to a clean silence]. Thorvald approaches the Baroque balcony doors. He braces himself - one hand clasping his coat tight, as the doors respond to him, slamming open. Wind and snow whirl into the room, blowing out the candles. The men gather their coats and join Thorvald on the balcony.  The courier cries out to the huddling figures of wool and fur for an answer. One man turns his head over his shoulder. He scuffs. The kid idles. What will he tell the general? His eyes dart around the room, seeing none of the gilded furniture, none of the grand oil paintings, none of the marble tiled flooring. He stops himself, blinking twice, pirouettes, and rushes out the hall. The men snicker on the balcony. A grand slam across the courtyard beckons Valdemar's exit from the castle. His figure marches across the snow-covered grounds, his great coat sweeping a broad path behind him. The gates slam again. The courier runs to catch up, yelling at Valdemar, his voice muffled by thick snow. As they reach the moat, the courier grabs on to Valdemar. Valdemar stops; his coat stops swinging. He turns, grabbing the boy by the shoulder. This lifts the boy, and he is flung head first into the embankment. He rolls into the moat, tangled in his coat. Valdemar marches. 



He attempts to persuade Valdemar to receive the message in private, but as Valdemar refuses, he finally has to deliver it within earshot of the company.

Valdemar slowly turns his head and fixes his stare on the man across from him. The men turn silent. He yells:

​	"Come in, then".

A courier, slight of stature, clad in blue, enters and closes the door behind him. He's clutching a letter with both hands.
