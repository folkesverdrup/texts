A real-time development of a multi-disciplinary method of work.  

Our choice of medium is film. The medium allows us to work in a broad field (*spoken word voice-overs, scoring and music, acted scenes, stills, graphical works, filming, script and text, scenography etc.*), that is all recorded and then, in the end, brought together in the editing room. 

editing, scoring, filming, acting, script, scenography.

heuristics applicable for content sorting, i.e. trusted sources

The gift of amateurship - no scholastic tautness holding you to a set of 'rules'. ()

A method of Heuristics based in one's background (i.e. architecture). In our case, and in this experiment, it will be pertaining mostly to creative endeavors 8above mentioned)

Something - something the drip of the stalactites draperies and straws, and the slow forming of the stalagmite mounds and flowstones. Culminating in the meeting of the two in a time-glass shaped 'column'. Something - something elaborate...

Jack-Of-All-Trades, Master Of...Some?



Method and technique; How to incorporate your knowledge into other fields. Some skills that are universally applicable (-talking now strictly from own experience.) Reading, Debating, Listening, Focusing, Writing, Drawing, Making (in the field of design - physical objects, i.e. a ceramic bowl or an architectural model.) How does my knowledge of how a particular thing is made influence or hinder my understanding of another things production method? 



Unlearning; as important a skill as learning. 



Riffing on RKs question list.

Why did we accept the A format (a4, Xerox)? Would we draw differently on round paper? on three-dimensional paper? Do we need paper at all, is it a good thing - a given? Are words imbued with meaning, or do they change? Why is progress always equated to the new? Should we wait and see? Does the word mean the same to the peoples when they speak it to each other?  Did we become better at communicating? No? Is 'purpose' more important than 'being'? What did we learn from religion? The answer seems to be that everything is better today than at any other time in history, can we really be so sure? Was the cro-magnon content? Did they enjoy things in the same way we do? How many times was bread invented? How many times were the same conclusion made, independently of each other? Why do so many still think the pyramids were made by unskilled slaves? Did anyone not wait to consider the more plausible theories? Was Steiner right about the 90 degree angle? Are we doing enough? Did we squeeze tight enough? Who determined 24? why not 48, 120? Stan, why are you so mad? What's an ending anyways? The thing that precedes the next? What's next?Is originality all that? Is classicism due a return, or is it still tainted by fascism? Did the get the proportions right, did they try everything? Is 'who cares' really a cop-out? How can I challenge my predispositions?
